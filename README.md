Beta licensing software is a web based project management application which allows a non redundant and safe storage of licenses on an a cloud based storage system ( DBMS ). The project allows large scale companies maintaining / issuing licenses and even private organizations maintaining validity of said people to store, edit and maintain information for the same. The website allows users to login to check the status of their license where as registered license providers can login and issue new licenses, change the status of the license and even delete a license. It is designed to be used online via the website, and does not require any additional programs / prerequisite applications to be installed. Users must be registered on the platform by providing their email address and a username.
